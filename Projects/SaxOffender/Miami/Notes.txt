Dual playfield, 3 bitplanes.
Double buffered copper list

PF1 (priority set to behind PF2)
--------------------------------
2 BPL DMA
Palm trees (bpl 3)
Sine scroller (bpl1)

Palm trees screen is 352(44)x272x1, single buffered. But is 3 screens wide (screen1, screen2, copy of screen1)
44x272=11968x3=35904

Sine scroller is 1bpl as above (35904) 
We draw in screen1 for main screen and screen 2 for double buffer to avoid wasting too much.

Total chip= 35904x3=107712

PF2

1 BPL DMA
Single line of 352. BPLMOD set to -44 to repeat the line.

Front layer (smaller height, bpl 2)



Color list is done via 4 copperlist sections that just contain the color list.
This list is accessed via a copjmp2.

Source_Palette (original palette info of words)

Current_Palette (copy of original source palette while transitions to another)
Current_Palette_Dark (darkened copy)
Current_Palette_Light (lightened copy)

Then create 4 copperlists with a random number 0-3 (and 4-1)
0-1 original
2 dark
3 light
